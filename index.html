														<h2>Face Recognition Game - 93% Mark</h2>
														<h2>Python and OpenCV Developed</h2>
													</header><p>For a University assignment, I successfully developed three engaging mini games targeting school children. Two of these games utilized Augmented Reality (AR), while one was built for Virtual Reality (VR). Throughout the development process, I utilized Python along with the OpenCV libraries to create these interactive experiences.</p>

													<p>One of the AR games incorporated a gamemode that employed face tracking. This feature allowed users to navigate and interact within a VR world by simply moving their face. It provided an immersive and intuitive way for children to engage with the game.</p>
													
													<p>The second AR game employed color tracking to detect and track markers, enabling children to complete various question-based challenges in an AR environment. By utilizing the camera feed, the game presented a unique perspective and enhanced the learning experience.</p>
													
													<p>The third game utilized face tracking technology to control a point on the screen. By detecting and tracking the user's face, children could manipulate the point's movement and interact with the game in an intuitive and engaging manner.</p>
													
													<p>I am delighted to share that I received a remarkable 93% mark for this assignment, which I am incredibly proud of. The outcome of the assignment not only showcased my proficiency in programming with Python and utilizing the OpenCV libraries but also demonstrated my ability to create interactive and educational experiences for young learners.</p>

														<h2>Project Outbreak || Co Owner - AI Lead</h2>
														<h2>Unity C# Developed</h2>
													</header>
													<p>Instead of pursuing a traditional placement year, I chose to embark on an entrepreneurial journey with a group of fellow students whom I met during a game jam. Together, we founded our own independent game development company called Indie-Shark Games. Over the course of a year, we dedicated our efforts to developing our own game titled Project Outbreak.</p>

													<p>Project Outbreak is a top-down roguelike game, and as the AI lead, my primary responsibility was to create sophisticated enemy AI systems. These enemies were designed to possess depth, working together as cohesive squads. I focused on developing modular AI behaviors that allowed for a dynamic selection of enemies during random generation. This ensured that the enemies could adapt and work together effectively in any given situation, while maintaining a sense of fairness for the player.</p>
													
													<p>In order to promote our game and company, we actively participated in various events and joined Game Republic. These opportunities provided a platform to showcase our game to a wider audience. Notably, we were able to present our game at Transfuzer 2020, a significant milestone for us.</p>
													
													<p>Regrettably, due to some team members having another year of university commitments, the project was left as a vertical slice. Nevertheless, we take immense pride in the progress we made and the accomplishments we achieved during this time.</p>
													
													<p>By venturing into entrepreneurship and creating our own game, I gained invaluable experience in project management, team collaboration, and AI development.</p>

														<h2>Bind and Banish</h2>
														<h2>Unity C# Developed</h2>
													</header>
													<p>As part of my Final Year Team Project, our team of seven members collaborated to develop an intriguing first-person ghost capturing game.</p>

													<p>In this project, I assumed the role of an AI programmer, primarily responsible for implementing various AI behaviors and developing a custom avoidance system. To control the ghost's behavior, I utilized a finite state machine approach. Some of the key AI behaviors I created include:</p>

													<p> - Flying around the room in a zigzag pattern: The ghost navigates through the environment, creating an eerie atmosphere.</p>
													<p> - Hiding in objects and manipulating lights: The ghost seeks refuge in objects, occasionally manipulating lights by turning them on and off. This dynamic behavior adds an element of surprise for the players.</p>
													<p> - Aggressive behavior when revealed: Once revealed, the ghost intensifies its actions by flying around the room, throwing objects at the player, and taunting them. This adds a thrilling element to the gameplay.</p>
													<p> - Group gathering and wandering: The ghosts gather in groups and navigate around the hotel environment using Unity Nav Mesh for pathfinding. I implemented my custom movement system to enhance their movement between waypoints.</p>


													<p>Additionally, I made significant contributions to several other systems within the game. However, I take immense pride in the development of the ghost movement system, which I consider to be my most notable achievement in the project.</p>

													<p>Our hard work and dedication paid off when our team received the Best Team award at The Game Republic Student Showcase 2021. This recognition is a testament to the collaborative efforts and successful outcomes achieved by our team.</p>

													<p>Working on this project not only allowed me to sharpen my AI programming skills but also provided valuable experience in teamwork, problem-solving, and software development. It further reinforced my passion for creating immersive and engaging experiences in the field of technology.
