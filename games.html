														<h2>Project Outbreak || Co Owner - AI Lead</h2>
														<h2>Unity C# Developed</h2>
													</header>
													
													<div class="hidden-text">
														<p>Instead of pursuing a traditional placement year, I chose to embark on an entrepreneurial journey with a group of fellow students whom I met during a game jam. Together, we founded our own independent game development company called Indie-Shark Games. Over the course of a year, we dedicated our efforts to developing our own game titled Project Outbreak.</p>

														<p>Project Outbreak is a top-down roguelike game, and as the AI lead, my primary responsibility was to create sophisticated enemy AI systems. These enemies were designed to possess depth, working together as cohesive squads. I focused on developing modular AI behaviors that allowed for a dynamic selection of enemies during random generation. This ensured that the enemies could adapt and work together effectively in any given situation, while maintaining a sense of fairness for the player.</p>
														
														<p>In order to promote our game and company, we actively participated in various events and joined Game Republic. These opportunities provided a platform to showcase our game to a wider audience. Notably, we were able to present our game at Transfuzer 2020, a significant milestone for us.</p>
														
														<p>Regrettably, due to some team members having another year of university commitments, the project was left as a vertical slice. Nevertheless, we take immense pride in the progress we made and the accomplishments we achieved during this time.</p>
														
														<p>By venturing into entrepreneurship and creating our own game, I gained invaluable experience in project management, team collaboration, and AI development.</p>

													<div class="hidden-text">
														<p>As part of my Final Year Team Project, our team of seven members collaborated to develop an intriguing first-person ghost capturing game.</p>

														<p>In this project, I assumed the role of an AI programmer, primarily responsible for implementing various AI behaviors and developing a custom avoidance system. To control the ghost's behavior, I utilized a finite state machine approach. Some of the key AI behaviors I created include:</p>

														<p> - Flying around the room in a zigzag pattern: The ghost navigates through the environment, creating an eerie atmosphere.</p>
														<p> - Hiding in objects and manipulating lights: The ghost seeks refuge in objects, occasionally manipulating lights by turning them on and off. This dynamic behavior adds an element of surprise for the players.</p>
														<p> - Aggressive behavior when revealed: Once revealed, the ghost intensifies its actions by flying around the room, throwing objects at the player, and taunting them. This adds a thrilling element to the gameplay.</p>
														<p> - Group gathering and wandering: The ghosts gather in groups and navigate around the hotel environment using Unity Nav Mesh for pathfinding. I implemented my custom movement system to enhance their movement between waypoints.</p>


														<p>Additionally, I made significant contributions to several other systems within the game. However, I take immense pride in the development of the ghost movement system, which I consider to be my most notable achievement in the project.</p>

														<p>Our hard work and dedication paid off when our team received the Best Team award at The Game Republic Student Showcase 2021. This recognition is a testament to the collaborative efforts and successful outcomes achieved by our team.</p>

														<p>Working on this project not only allowed me to sharpen my AI programming skills but also provided valuable experience in teamwork, problem-solving, and software development. It further reinforced my passion for creating immersive and engaging experiences in the field of technology.
